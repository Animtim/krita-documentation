This docker allows you to select the global pattern. Using the open-file button you can import patterns. Some common shortcuts are the following:

* |mouseright| a swatch will allow you to set tags.
* |mouseleft| a swatch will allow you to set it as global pattern.
* :kbd:`Ctrl` + Scroll you can resize the swatch sizes.
