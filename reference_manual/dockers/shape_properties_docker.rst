.. warning::
    This docker is deprecated, and its functionality is folded into the :ref:`shape_edit_tool`

This docker is only functional when selecting a rectangle or circle on a vector layer. It allows you to change minor details, such as the rounding of the corners of a rectangle, or the angle of the formula for the circle-shape.
